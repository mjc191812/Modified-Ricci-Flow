# NormalizedRicciFlow

This is the code of the paper **A modified Ricci flow on arbitrary weighted graph**

## Abstract
In this paper, we propose a modified Ricci flow,  as well as a quasi-normalized Ricci flow, on arbitrary weighted graph. Each flow has a unique and global solution on all edges. In particular, we do not need the exit condition as in a recent work of Bai et al. These modified Ricci flows are applied to community detection for complex networks, including Karate Club, American football games, Facebook, as well as artificial networks. 
In our algorithms, we don't need to have surgery at each iteration; instead, we just need to delete some edges with heavy weights after the final iteration. From three criteria for evaluating community detection algorithms, ARI, NMI and Q, we conclude that
our algorithms outperform existing algorithms, including Ollivier's Ricci flow , normalized Ollivier's Ricci flow and normalized Lin-Lu-Yau's Ricci flow.
